WebTicker

Instructions for running:
Clone repo (pull changes) and run shotgun.
Currently, the database has in it one teacher account:

  Username: Jens
  Password: seriesoftubes

And one student account:

  Username: Eli
  Password: likeaboss

Also, there are three tickers:

  Computer Networks
  Cyber Security
  CS171

A student can view the page for a ticker, but each ticker page only displays the name of the student currently viewing it.

TODO:
 ~Fix teacher's and students' ticker view so that it reflects one list of all the students currently in the class.
